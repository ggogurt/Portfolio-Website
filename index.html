        I am proud of my work, sometimes its hard to be however. Something that makes me excited to create new work is the process. Working on different variations of posters or sitting down for hours to collage. I love it but also it is so anxiety inducing. I feel proud but extremely nervous to go to crit with it. The only personal philosophy I would follow while creating is: If there's something more interesting or a new style you want to follow, go with that.
